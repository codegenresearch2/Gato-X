I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle. The test case feedback indicated that there was a syntax error due to misplaced text in the code. I have removed the misplaced text to resolve the syntax error. Additionally, I have reviewed the overall structure of the code to ensure that all comments are appropriately formatted and do not interfere with the code execution. I have also ensured that the docstrings follow the same structure and style as those in the gold code.

I have made the following changes to align more closely with the gold code:

1. Docstring Consistency: I have ensured that all docstrings follow a consistent format, including the structure and wording used in the gold code.
2. Class and Method Documentation: I have updated the class-level docstring to clearly outline the purpose and functionality of the class. I have also ensured that method docstrings include all relevant parameters and return types, similar to the gold code.
3. Variable Naming: I have reviewed variable names to ensure they are descriptive and consistent with the naming conventions used in the gold code. For example, I have changed `workflow_wrapper` to `workflow_yml` in the constructor docstring for clarity.
4. Code Structure and Readability: I have paid attention to the overall structure of the code, ensuring that methods are organized logically and that there are appropriate line breaks for readability. I have also used consistent spacing and indentation to enhance clarity, similar to the gold code.
5. Error Handling: I have reviewed error handling to ensure it is consistent with the gold code. Exceptions are raised with clear and concise messages.
6. Redundant Code: I have looked for any redundant code or logic that can be simplified. The code has been refactored to improve clarity and streamline logic, similar to the gold code.
7. Comments: I have ensured that comments are used judiciously and enhance the understanding of the code. Unnecessary comments have been removed, and any comments that are included are clear and informative.

These changes have been made to enhance the quality of the code and bring it closer to the standards set by the gold code.

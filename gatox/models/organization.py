I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle.

1. I have initialized the `name` attribute to `None` before setting it to the value from `org_data` to match the style of the gold code.
2. I have ensured that type annotations are used consistently for `secrets` and `runners` during initialization.
3. I have restructured the conditions for setting `org_admin_user` and `org_member` to match the hierarchy seen in the gold code.
4. I have ensured that the order of methods in the class matches the order in the gold code.
5. I have adjusted the formatting of the dictionary in the `toJSON` method to be consistent with the gold code, paying attention to line breaks and indentation for better readability.
6. I have ensured that comments are concise and match the style of the gold code.

These changes should bring the code closer to the gold standard.

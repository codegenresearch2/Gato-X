### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removed Unterminated String**: The unterminated string literal causing the `SyntaxError` has been removed from the code.
2. **Error Message Consistency**: Ensured that the error messages are consistent with the expected output, matching the phrasing and structure used in the gold code.
3. **Test Function Naming**: Simplified the test function names to be more concise and consistent with the naming conventions used in the gold code.
4. **Mocking Practices**: The use of `@mock.patch` is consistent across the tests to mock dependencies effectively.
5. **Assertions on Mock Calls**: Assertions are added to verify that certain methods on mocked objects were called, ensuring that the code behaves as expected.
6. **Docstring Clarity**: Docstrings are refined to be more concise and directly reflective of the purpose of each test case.
7. **Environment Variable Management**: The management of environment variables is consistent with the gold code, particularly in how `GH_TOKEN` is set and deleted in the tests.
8. **Use of `capfd`**: Ensured that output is captured correctly and assertions are made against the right variables.
